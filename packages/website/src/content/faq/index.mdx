    # Buyers FAQs
    - title: What am I buying as a Buyer?
      content: You are purchasing beneficial rights to cashflows from a pool of Ar-Rahnu receivables. These are profit/ujrah-based returns (not interest), derived from the safekeeping and service fees charged by the Seller to customers who have pawned collateral.
    - title: Is this Shariah-compliant?
      content: Yes. All structures follow the Ar-Rahnu (secured loan) principle with ujrah for safekeeping and service. Each investment note is reviewed under a Shariah framework and full documentation is provided. 100% compliance with Islamic finance principles.
    - title: Who holds the collateral?
      content: The Seller (licensed pawnbroker) retains custody of the collateral per Ar-Rahnu regulations. Liquid records all data and settlement transactions, but does not hold physical collateral. This ensures regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.
    - title: What is the typical tenor?
      content: Typical tenors range from 1–6 months. Extensions and auctions are handled within policy and disclosed in deal documents. Early exit may be possible via the secondary market.
    - title: How is risk managed?
      content: Risk is managed through collateral coverage ratios, redemption history analysis, auction procedures, concentration limits, and ongoing cohort analytics. Each portfolio is assigned a risk band based on origination LTV and historical performance.

    # Sellers FAQs
    - title: Who can be a Seller on Liquid?
      content: Any licensed Ar-Rahnu operator (pawnbroker) operating in Malaysia can become a Seller. You must pass KYC/AML screening and provide valid regulatory documentation.
    - title: What documents do I need to upload?
      content: You'll need to provide your active pawnbroking license, Shariah governance policies, recent audit reports (if applicable), and KYC compliance documentation. Your receivables must include ticket IDs, amounts, collateral values, and maturity dates.
    - title: How quickly can I get funded?
      content: After verification (typically 3–5 business days), your portfolio is listed. Funding timing depends on buyer demand but can occur within days of listing in active market conditions.
    - title: What are the fees?
      content: Fees vary based on portfolio size, risk band, and market conditions. Detailed fee schedules are provided during onboarding. All fees are transparent and disclosed upfront.
    - title: Can I continue servicing customers while my receivables are listed?
      content: Yes. You retain operational control of customer relationships. Liquid purchases the beneficial rights to redemption proceeds, but you continue managing collections and customer service.

    # General/Legal FAQs
    - title: Is Liquid regulated?
      content: Liquid operates as a Shariah-compliant receivables marketplace in Malaysia. Operations comply with Securities Commission Malaysia guidelines and Islamic finance governance principles.
    - title: What happens if a customer defaults?
      content: Ar-Rahnu assets are backed by physical collateral. In case of default, the collateral is typically auctioned or sold per the terms of the original pawn agreement. Buyers bear the proportional share of any shortfall.
    - title: Can I exit early as a Buyer?
      content: Secondary market access may be available for early exit, subject to availability. Check individual deal terms for specific secondary market provisions.
    - title: How are redemptions handled?
      content: When a customer redeems their collateral, the Seller releases it and the redemption proceeds flow back to settle the Buyer's beneficial rights according to the agreement.
    - title: What data and transparency do I get?
      content: Real-time dashboards provide cohort stats (redemption rate, aging, LTV, coverage ratios), transaction history, collections data, and auction results. Full deal documentation is available for review.
